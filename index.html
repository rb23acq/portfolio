      <h2 class="introduction-pre">About me</h2>
      
      <p class="aboutme-text-intro">
        <strong>I am an enthusiastic second (II) year student of Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence at University of Hertfordshire with a rich
        experience of over 2 years in website & product design.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        With years of experience in web development I have mastered the 
        skills of understanding client requirements according to the latest
         trends. I have worked with businesses from different niches so you
          can rely on me for yours.


        I’ve spent most of these years working across different areas of design
         like front-end development, landing pages, email design, app UI/UX, to 
         my current role designing websites. Having worked on various projects
          that are already live, I can help you with the best possible 
          suggestions and ideas that we can proceed with. With me, you aren’t
           forced to accept anything. I give you a variety of options we can work
            on together.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in the fact that learning never stops and I am interested in learning new technologies and programming languages that will help me design and develop a better output in less time.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="introduction-pre">What I do</h2>
      <p>
        From understanding your requirements, designing a blueprint and delivering the final product, I do everything that falls in between these lines.
      </p>
      <ul class="whatido-list">
        <li>
          <h3>UI/UX Design </h3>
          <p>
            An effective UI/UX is what captures attention and spreads a clear message. I make sure the design is innovative and neat with all of this.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Web Development </h3>
          <p>
            If you are looking for a developer who’ll take over the research and development of your website, I am a well-established professional to help you with this.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Logo & Graphic Design </h3>
          <p>
            It’s a good practise to get your logos, images and website done from one source. I can help you design those that will fit and match into the website and app quickly.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3> Copywriting & Content Creation </h3>
          <p>
            Just like graphics, the content and your website or app design should also go hand-in-hand. So, I can help you create amazing content that complements my design and your business.
