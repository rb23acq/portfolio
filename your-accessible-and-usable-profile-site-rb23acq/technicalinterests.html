        <h2 class="introduction-pre">Interests</h2>
  <p>
   My interests have changed over the years. After finishing law school I came to
   the realization that I was not made for that kind of job. The work was very exhausting
   and the results were insignificant on a personal level. After a few years of searching for 
   my passions and interests I've found web development, which "pushed" me into a deep rabbit hole
   finding A.I. and now my newest interest Robotics.

   <h4>
   Here you can find a few ideas on how I'd describe my technical interests:

      <h3 >Web Development: Creating a Digital Experience </h3>
    
    <p>
       The backbone of today's digital age is Web development, which make it possible 
       to create captivating websites and applications that connect and help people all over the world.
       It combines creativity with technicality and logic to create user-friendly interfaces and systems.
       The ongoing development of technologies keeps me intrigued and wondering how fast
       can the industry grow.
       In my personal experience, on the way of learning web development, I came across many different languages and libraries such as HTML5, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap,Next.JS,React,Vite,Angular,Three.js, TypeScript.

      <h3>Robotics: Next Big Industry</h3>
    
    <p>
        Robotics it's a combination of everything, Engineering, Computer Science and A.I. and all 
        these technologies can be used together in order to build very interesting machines.
        This is one of the topics I know very little about but day by day I try to learn a bit more about it.
        Learning how to use servos and Arduino boards was a start for me, also using a bread board and wires.
        Learning how to use different programming languages makes it entertaining, such as C, C++, Java and Python.

      <h3>Artificial Intelligence (A.I.): The future </h3>
     
    <p>
        A.I. for me represents the future innovation in technology. I was mesmerized by the idea
        of a machine being able to mimic human functions such as learning or decision-making. I do not know much about A.I. topics
        at this point, but I can say that it's a revolutionary technology with it's power to analyze large sets of data
        and generate amazing results.
